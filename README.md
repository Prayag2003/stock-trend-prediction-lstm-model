# Stock Trend Prediction using LSTM

Stock Trend Prediction

## Overview

This is my first machine learning project on stock trend prediction using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning model. The project aims to predict the future trend of a stock based on historical data, utilizing the Time Series analysis approach. The dataset used for training and testing the model consists of stock opening, closing, high, and low data values, which were scraped from Yahoo Finance and cover the period from the year 2010 to 2022.

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- numpy
- sklearn
- pandas

## You can install the dependencies using the following command:

- pip install -r requirements.txt

## Getting Started

- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Open the Jupyter notebook (or any Python IDE of your choice) and load the stock_trend_prediction.ipynb file.
  Project Structure

### The project is structured as follows:

- stock_trend_prediction.ipynb
- app.py which consists of the Streamlit application
- requirements.txt
- README.md

## Usage

Run the Jupyter notebook cells sequentially in stock_trend_prediction.ipynb to train the LSTM model on the provided dataset and make predictions. The notebook contains detailed explanations of each step, making it easy to follow along.

## Results

The trained LSTM model will make predictions on the test data and evaluate its performance.
